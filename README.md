# JavaFxProject
This project is a Snake vs Block game.
For the frontend part, we used JavaFX. Major emphasis was on implementing the whole project in a very Object Oriented Manner using the OOPs concepts where-ever necessary. Multithreading was also taken care of to handle all the components(snake, walls, points etc) concurrent working. Exception handling (default and user defined) and Java Collections framework were also used.
